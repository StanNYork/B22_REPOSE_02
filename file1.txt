A formula is a package definition written in Ruby. It can be created with brew create <URL> where <URL> is a zip or tarball, installed with brew install <formula>, and debugged with brew install --debug --verbose <formula>. Formulae use the Formula API which provides various Homebrew-specific helpers.
